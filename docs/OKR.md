# Cloud-Based Natural Language to OpenSCENARIO Generation with RAG and NCAP Integration

## Objective
Develop and deploy a cloud-native, intelligent system on AWS that leverages RAG technology and NCAP scenario examples to generate OpenSCENARIO simulations from natural language descriptions, with automated CI/CD pipelines and comprehensive monitoring.

## Key Results

### KR1: MVP Deliverables
- [ ] Basic web interface for natural language input
- [ ] Core scenario generation engine with RAG capabilities
- [ ] Integration with one NCAP scenario
- [ ] Custom player integration for scenario visualization and validation
- [ ] Initial documentation and setup guide

### KR2: AWS Cloud Infrastructure
- [ ] Design and implement scalable AWS architecture using ECS/EKS for container orchestration
- [ ] Set up secure VPC, IAM roles, and network configurations following AWS best practices
- [ ] Configure custom player in a containerized environment for cloud deployment

### KR3: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- [ ] Set up end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild or GitHub Actions
- [ ] Implement automated testing with scenario validation
- [ ] Achieve deployment frequency of multiple times per day with zero-downtime deployments

### KR4: Monitoring and Observability
- [ ] Implement comprehensive monitoring using CloudWatch, X-Ray, and custom metrics
- [ ] Set up alerts for system health and performance degradation
- [ ] Create dashboards for real-time visibility into system usage and performance

### KR5: Performance & Cost Optimization
- [ ] Implement cost monitoring and optimization for all AWS services
- [ ] Achieve average scenario generation and simulation time under 15 seconds at scale
- [ ] Optimize resource usage in cloud environment
